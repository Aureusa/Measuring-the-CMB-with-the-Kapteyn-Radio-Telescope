# Measuring the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with the Kapteyn Radio Telescope

This repository contains code and data for the second assignment in the Introduction to Radio Astronomy course. The objective is to measure the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using the Kapteyn Radio Telescope.

## Repository Status

**This repository is archived. No further development or maintenance is planned. Contributions, issues, and pull requests are not being accepted.**

## Repository Contents

- **CMB data/**: Directory containing observational data files.
- **estimators.py**: Python script with functions to process and analyze the data.
- **main.py**: Main script to execute the analysis.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions supporting the main analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies required to run the scripts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aureusa/Measuring-the-CMB-with-the-Kapteyn-Radio-Telescope.git
   cd Measuring-the-CMB-with-the-Kapteyn-Radio-Telescope
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Background

The Kapteyn Radio Telescope is an 11 GHz radio telescope designed to measure the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The telescope was developed as part of a Bachelor Thesis project at the University of Groningen.
